# Final Project Report

**Project _7_:** _Visualising our Transport Networks_<br>
**Client:** _Chris Vallyon_<br>
**Date:** 11 October 2019<br>

<!-- _This is not expected to be a long report and volume will not be rewarded! The purpose of the final report is to summarise and document anything within your project and other documentation that is tacit or implicit, and any assumptions or motivations which can't_ easily _be found elsewhere in your hand-over documentation. If you wish to follow the form of the example final report in the textbook, then you are welcome to do so. **This is primarily a client-facing document.**_

_All text in italics in this template should be replaced by your answers (in regular font). This introductory paragraph should be deleted._ -->

#### Project Objective(s)

<!-- _A short statement, 1-3 sentences, of project objective(s); a short abstract of project goals. Simply repeating the original description of the project from ENGR 301, or providing a bland and repetitive description is a waste of everyone's time. What is expected here is a summary of the project objectives as embodied in the_ as-delivered _project._ -->

In ENGR301 and ENGR302 courses at Victoria University of Wellington, the team was tasked to develop a web application in order to visualise the network flow into major cities. The application was built to support planning and decisions around any changes to city transport networks.

#### Summary of Project Results

<!-- _A statement, summarising the results of the project; what actually resulted from project execution. This should convey to the reader those aspects of the project results which are not obvious from other documents._ -->

The project results are a web application that shows a visualisation of the traffic congestion in the Wellington City Council area for different periods in a day. Alongside project delivery, the team collectively learned about an agile way of working while developing project management skills.

#### Original and Delivered Scope

<!-- _The things that are within scope of the delivered project; the things that the delivered project can do. This should convey to the reader those aspects of the project results which are not obvious from other documents. If the project has a significant Issue backlog on delivery, a summary of the pending features, why these features were not completed and how they could be picked up by others if project work was to resume._ -->

#### Original and Actual Schedule

The Virtualising our Transport Networks App is a decision support tool designed to allow transport planners, road control authorities and public transport operators gain insight on effective transport decisions which support the existing network pathways by a visual analysis of the transport flow data. The system should be able to run on any browser. It will display an observation on how long it takes to get to the CBD from a set origin on a map, where the zones between the origin and destination will be coloured based on an interpolation of the time taken against the distance from the origin. Users can add CSV data sets to the application in order to display the information. The goal is to deliver a web application which will display a terrain topographic map which shows how long it takes to get into the city from different sections of a region using different modes such as cars, trains and buses. Another aim is for the map to use the same units as Statistics New Zealand's census data units to further increase the effectiveness of the display analysis and apply users to make insight-driven decisions made in the transport sector. The regions will, therefore, adapted to show census regions, rather than the set distance zones it currently is. This would make it more useful for consultants as decisions can be made dependent on different and specific socio-economic groups.

_A summary of the original timelines and a summary of deviations from the original plan. This should convey to the reader those aspects of the project results which are not obvious from other documents._

**Original Scope**

#### Delivered Expenditure

_How much was spent, as a single number. If there has been deviation from the original plan then this should be explained in summary. Projects with no expenditure should state “No expenditure” for this section._

#### Project Self-Assessment

_A short statement of the team’s assessment of the delivered project, with a focus on the technical aspects. This should convey to the reader those aspects of the project results which are not obvious from other documents._

#### Lessons Learned

_Lessons learned which are of significance, impact and priority to the client. The focus here is on the lessons-learned at the intersection of the technical and management aspects of your project which are relevant to the client. Projects which have encountered significant technical or non-technical issues which will be of particular relevance to the client or the client's organisation should document these in this section._

#### Procurement Summary

_A description of procurements, naming major suppliers, stating where to find the procurement information in the project documents and flagging any unclosed procurements. Projects with no procurements should state “No procurements” for this section._
