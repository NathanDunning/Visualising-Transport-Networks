# Project Transition Plan

**Project 7:** Visualising our Transport Networks<br>
**Client:** Chris Vallyon<br>
**Date:** 11 October 2019<br>

<!-- _The Project Transition Plan is a detailed description of the procedures and resources required to transition the project from the University to the client. A Project Transition Plan should provide a reference-point and guide to the team and also to anyone needing to assist with the project transition to the client. **This is primarily an internally-facing document.**_ -->

<!-- _All text in italics in this template should be replaced by your answers in regular font. This introductory paragraph should be deleted._ -->

### Introduction

This project transition plan is a detailed description of the procedures and resources required for the transition of the project from Victoria University of Wellington to the client, Chris Vallyon.

### Assumptions

<!-- _What is assumed to be present for project transition to complete successfully. It could be technical or non-technical resources. These will be the things that have not been explicitly agreed or for which there is some uncertainty. Note that "success" means project integration or addition (see below for definitions)._ -->

Our understanding is that this project will be handed over to an individual or small group of people to be further developed. Therefore, this section is a guide for the person(s) who will adopt this project.

**Technical Assumptions**

It is assumed that the person(s) who will continue the development of this project will have experience in the following technical areas.

1. The person(s) should also have an understanding of applications that follow a client-server architecture.

2. The person(s) should have experience with or a willingness to learn the following programming languages:

   - Javascript (front-end package)
   - CSS (front-end package)
   - Java (back-end and data package)
   - SQL (back-end package)

3. The person(s) should have experience with or a willingness to learn the following frameworks:

   - React (front-end package)
   - Spring (back-end package)

4. The person(s) should have experience with or a willingness to learn the following libraries:

   - Material UI (front-end package)
     - UI components
   - Leaflet (front-end and back-end package)
     - Mapping features

`To be clarified`

Is the deployment process (to Heroku) part of the transition plan? I don't believe it is part of the project scope.

**Non-technical Assumptions**

It is assumed that the person(s) who will continue the development of this project will have experience in the following non-technical areas.

1. The person(s) should have an interest in data analysis and visualisation.

2. The person(s) should be interested in helping improve the transport system in New Zealand.

3. The person(s) should have strong communication, decision-making, and teamwork skills so that they can interact effectively with the client.

4. The person(s) should have strong time-management skills so that they can manage the remainder of the project scope effectively.

5. The person(s) should understand and follow the policy of the stakeholders.

### Organisational

<!-- _Technical and non-technical organisational support required on the part of both parties for project transition to be completed. Note that "success" means project integration or addition (see below for definitions)._ -->

The following items require organisational support on the part of both parties; the team, and the client, for project transition to be completed.

**Technical Organisation**

1. The transition of the project code and code documentation hosted on GitLab.

2. The transition of the project application as deployed on Heroku.

**Non-technical Organisation**

1. The transition of the handover and supporting documents.

### Work Required

<!-- _A list of the work required for the project transition to be completed. Note that "success" means project integration or addition (see below for definitions)._ -->

The following is a list of the work required for the project transition to be completed.

**Technical Work**

1. The project code and code documentation hosted on GitLab.

   - Our project code and code documentation are currently hosted and managed through our GitLab repository. That said, the repository is owned by Victoria University. To maintain the version control history of the project, the best transference solution would be for the client to have a clone the repository of which they would then push to another Git repository in the future, to reinstate the version control history.

   - This can be achieved by either transferring ownership of the GitLab repository to the client or by packaging the project code and documentation into a zip file to be then emailed to the client via the ELF (exchange of Large Files) service. http://elf.ecs.victoria.ac.nz/

   - Although the repository will most likely be cloned and emailed to the client using the ELF service, it may be wise to keep the existing repository as the person(s) who will continue development on behalf of the client may find it more valuable to have ownership of the project repository transferred to them directly.

   - Things to note are that the client is non-technical and will not create a GitLab or GitHub repository for which we can add as a remote and mirror the project repository.

`To be clarified`

Clarify with the client whether the person(s) who will continue the project will want ownership of the existing repository, or will clone it and push it to their repository?

2. The project application as deployed on Heroku.

   - Our project application is currently deployed through the Heroku account set up for our project team. The account is owned and managed by James Quilty, who is the admin for the account. He is also the person in charge of the payment of the current subscription plan which allows the application to stay live 24/7.

   - This can be achieved by transferring ownership of the Heroku account with the active deployment to the client. The only issue that may occur with this is that the client will need to maintain the paid subscription for the application to stay live 24/7 as it is currently. James Quilty needs to be aware of this transfer so he can grant the change of users.

**Non-technical Resources**

1. The handover documents.

   - This can be achieved by transferring digital copies of the documents via email, in person, through the GitLab repository, or the package of the project code and code documentation with the ELF system.

### Schedule

<!-- _A timeline of when the work required will need to be performed for the project transition to be completed. This can quite legitimately be links to the Roadmap, to Epics and/or to Milestones, as long as those are sensible and well-maintained. Note that "success" means project integration or addition (see below for definitions)._ -->

The following is a timeline of when the work required needs to be completed for the project transition to be completed.

**Technical Schedule**

1. Project code and code documentation hosted on GitLab.

   - The project code and code documentation will need to be completed by Friday, the 11th of October. To meet this deadline, the team will need to consider the remainder of the scope and decide which parts can and cannot be completed by this time. Thie team will also need to factor the time required to document the code and to configure the GitLab repository so that it is of a state that can be presented to the client.

   - The final milestone of the project which details the issues concerning the remainder of the scope are detailed in the following link: https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/groups/ENGR300-2019/Project-07/-/milestones/10

2. The project application as deployed on Heroku.

   - The process for the transition of ownership of the Heroku account will be decided in the next client meeting. The next client meeting has been rescheduled from the 10th of October to the 11th. As this is the day of project handover, we will need to have the GitLab repository in presentable order first, as the Heroku repository is a remote of the project repository.

**Non-technical Schedule**

1. The handover and supporting documents.

   - The handover and any supporting documents will need to be drafted, proof-read, and signed-off by each member of the team before they are submitted to the client on Friday, the 11th of October. The final sign-off document that measures the project scope will be submitted to the client at the final presentation.

<!-- ### _Notes_ -->

<!-- _Successful project transition is integration or addition of the project into the client's organisation. **Integration** is where the products and services created are integrated into the client's operations; **Addition** is where the new product or service results in a new unit in the client's organisation, such as a department, division, or company._ -->
