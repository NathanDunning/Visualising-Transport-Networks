# Project Transition Plan

**Project 7:** Visualising our Transport Networks<br>
**Client:** Chris Vallyon<br>
**Date:** 11 October 2019<br>

## Introduction

This project transition plan is a description of the procedures and resources required for the transition of the project from Victoria University of Wellington to the client, Chris Vallyon.

## Assumptions

Our understanding is that this project will be handed over to an individual or small group of people to be further developed. Therefore, this section is a guide for the person(s) who will adopt this project.

**Technical Assumptions**

It is assumed that the person(s) who will continue the development of this project will have experience in the following technical areas.

1. The person(s) should also have an understanding of applications that follow a client-server architecture.

2. The person(s) should have experience with or a willingness to learn the following programming languages:

   - Javascript (front-end package)
   - CSS (front-end package)
   - Java (back-end and data package)
   - SQL (back-end package)

3. The person(s) should have experience with or a willingness to learn the following frameworks:

   - React (front-end package)
   - Spring (back-end package)

4. The person(s) should have experience with or a willingness to learn the following libraries:

   - Material UI (front-end package)
     - UI components
   - Leaflet (front-end and back-end package)
     - Mapping features

**Non-Technical Assumptions**

It is assumed that the person(s) who will continue the development of this project will have experience in the following non-technical areas.

1. The person(s) should have an interest in data analysis and visualisation.

2. The person(s) should be interested in helping improve the transport system in New Zealand.

3. The person(s) should have strong communication, decision-making, and teamwork skills so that they can interact effectively with the client.

4. The person(s) should have strong time-management skills so that they can manage the remainder of the project scope effectively.

5. The person(s) should understand and follow the policy of the stakeholders.

## Organisational

The following items require organisational support on the part of both parties; the team, and the client, for project transition to be completed.

**Technical Organisation**

1. The transition of the project code and code documentation hosted on GitLab.

2. The transition of the project application as deployed on Heroku.

**Non-Technical Organisation**

1. The transition of the handover and supporting documents.

## Work Required

The following is a list of the work required for the project transition to be completed.

**Technical Work**

1. The project code and code documentation hosted on GitLab.

   - Our project code and code documentation are currently hosted and managed through our GitLab repository. That said, the repository is owned by Victoria University. To maintain the version control history of the project, the best transference solution would be for the client to have a clone the repository of which they would then push to another Git repository in the future, to reinstate the version control history.

   - This can be achieved by transferring ownership of the GitLab repository to the client and by packaging the project code and documentation into a zip file to be then emailed to the client via the ELF (exchange of Large Files) service. http://elf.ecs.victoria.ac.nz/

   - Although the repository will be cloned and emailed to the client using the ELF service, it may be wise to keep the existing repository as the person(s) who will continue development on behalf of the client may find it more valuable to have ownership of the project repository transferred to them directly.

2. The project application as deployed on Heroku.

   - Our project application is currently deployed through the Heroku account set up for our project team. The account is owned and managed by James Quilty, who is the admin for the account. He is also the person in charge of the payment of the current subscription plan which allows the application to stay live 24/7.

   - This can be achieved by transferring ownership of the Heroku account with the active deployment to the client. The only issue that may occur with this is that the client will need to maintain the paid subscription for the application to stay live 24/7 as it is currently. James Quilty needs to be aware of this transfer so he can grant the change of users.

**Non-Technical Resources**

1. The handover documents.

   - This can be achieved by transferring digital copies of the documents via email, in person, through the GitLab repository, or the package of the project code and code documentation with the ELF system.

## Schedule

The following is a timeline of when the work required needs to be completed for the project transition to be completed.

**Technical Schedule**

1. Project code and code documentation hosted on GitLab.

   - The project code and code documentation will need to be completed by Friday, the 11th of October. To meet this deadline, the team will need to consider the remainder of the scope and decide which parts can and cannot be completed by this time. Thie team will also need to factor the time required to document the code and to configure the GitLab repository so that it is of a state that can be presented to the client.

   - The final milestone of the project which details the issues concerning the remainder of the scope are detailed in the following link:

     https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/groups/ENGR300-2019/Project-07/-/milestones/10

2. The project application as deployed on Heroku.

   - The process for the transition of ownership of the Heroku account was discussed in the final client meeting before the handover deadline. The client is still unsure if they want to take ownership of the Heroku account due to the subscription cost to keep the application running 24/7. The client is aware of the free subscription plan and will inform the team about whether they will take ownership of the account in a future client-team meeting.

**Non-Technical Schedule**

1. The handover and supporting documents.

   - The handover and any supporting documents will need to be drafted, proof-read, and signed-off by each member of the team before they are submitted to the client on Friday, the 11th of October. The final sign-off document that measures the project scope will be submitted to the client at the final presentation.
