# Project Transition Plan

**Project 7:** Visualising our Transport Networks<br>
**Client:** Chris Vallyon<br>
**Date:** 11 October 2019<br>

_The Project Transition Plan is a detailed description of procedures and resources required to transition the project from the University to the client. A Project Transition Plan should provide a reference-point and guide to the team and also to anyone needing to assist with the project transition to the client. **This is primarily an internally-facing document.**_

_All text in italics in this template should be replaced by your answers in regular font. This introductory paragraph should be deleted._

### Assumptions

_What is assumed to be present for project transition to complete successfully. Could be technical or non-technical resources. These will be the things that have not been explicitly agreed or for which there is some uncertainty. Note that "success" means project integration or addition (see below for definitions)._

Our understanding is that this project will be handed over to an individual or small group of people to be further developed over the third trimester.

#### Technical Resources

Is is assumed that the person(s) who will continue the development of this project will have experience in the following technical areas.

1. The person(s) should have an understanding of developing web applications built with the React framework.

2. The person(s) should also have an understanding of applications that follow a client-server architecture.

3. The person(s) should have experience with or a willingness to learn the following programming languages:

   - Javascript (front-end package)
   - CSS (front-end package)
   - Java (back-end and data package)
   - SQL (back-end package)

4. The person(s) should have experience with or a willingness to learn the following frameworks:

   - React (front-end package)
   - Spring (back-end package)

5. The person(s) should have experience with or a willingness to learn the following libraries:

   - Material UI (front-end package)
     - UI components
   - Leaflet (front-end and back-end package)
     - Mapping features

`To be clarified`

Is the deployment process (to Heroku) part of the transition plan? I don't believe it is part of the project scope.

#### Non-technical Resources

Is is assumed that the person(s) who will continue the development of this project will have experience in the following technical areas.

1. The person(s) should have an interest in analysing different modes of transport and the current state of traffic flow on major city networks in New Zealand.

2. The person(s) should have strong communcation, decision-making, and teamwork skills, so that they can interact effectively with the client.

3. The person(s) should be have strong time-management skills so that they can manage the remainder of the project scope effectively.

`To be clarified`

Is this section supposed to consider risks? I'm not sure if my answer to this section is what is expected.

### Organisational

_Technical and non-technical organisational support required on the part of both parties for project transition to be successfully completed. Note that "success" means project integration or addition (see below for definitions)._

### Work Required

_A list of the work required for the project transition to be successfully completed. Note that "success" means project integration or addition (see below for definitions)._

### Schedule

_A timeline of when the work required will need to be performed for project transition to be successfully completed. This can quite legitimately be links to the Roadmap, to Epics and/or to Milestones, as long as those are sensible and well-maintained. Note that "success" means project integration or addition (see below for definitions)._

### _Notes_

_Successful project transition is integration or addition of the project into the client's organisation. **Integration** is where the products and services created are integrated into the client's operations; **Addition** is where the new product or service results in a new unit in the client's organisation, such as a department, division, or company._
